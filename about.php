                                 <p>Organisations need external help with digital projects more than ever. However, the shape of the teams that provide this help is changing.</p><p>Large, multi-layered agencies are being replaced by smaller, focused design practices that can respond more rapidly and efficiently to customer and business needs.
 </p><p>These practices consist exclusively of senior, highly experienced digital professionals, working individually or as part of tightly run co-operatives.
</p><p>
This is the approach we take at Berridge + Co. It’s enabled us to produce impressive results for some <a class="plainlink" href="#clientsanchor">major clients</a>. And we could do the same for you.
</p>
                 
                    <p class="subhead">One man or one team. It’s up to you.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the demands of your project, I can work in one of two ways. I can come on board as an individual design consultant, with a hands-on approach to every detail. </p><p>Or I can create and lead a team of digital experts, consisting of industry-leading strategists, researchers, designers, content creators and developers. (I call these teams <a class="plainlink" href="supergroups">Supergroups</a>.)</p>
                    
                    <p class="subhead">Whatever your aims, we have a plan.</p>

                    <p>Your project could be large-scale or niche. Appealing to a huge global audience or a precisely targeted customer group. I can help you achieve success in any of these scenarios – with experience ranging from start-up launches to blue-chip redesigns, and all stops in between. 
</p> 
                    <p>

And customer experience can take many forms. Maybe you need to create a new brand identity, develop an e-commerce site or set up a design system. Whatever your objectives, we know how to help you meet them.
</p>
<p>
Working with me, you can expect strategic direction, hands-on design and project management. With one of my Supergroups, you get all this, plus the talents of my specialist partners.
</p>
<p>
Together, we cover all aspects of digital. Every discipline you’ll need to create outstanding customer experiences.
